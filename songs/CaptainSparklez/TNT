I came to dig dig dig dig
I'll build a city oh so big big big big
Just wait a sec, gotta kill this pig pig pig pig
Cook me some bacon and take a swig swig swig swig
Yeah, yeah
There must be something I can craft
To ease the burden of this task
Yeah
I shoot my arrows in the air sometimes
Saying ay-oh, that creeper's ko'd
Loot his remains and now his sulfur's mine
Saying ay-oh, not today no
And then I'll go to work
Under the birch tree
And I'll make myself
Tons of tnt
Cause I'll use these blocks
I'll build a big city
And I'll mine it all
Using tnt
I came to blow blow blow blow
Up everything you've ever known known known known
Expel you out of house and home home home home
Biome to biome you shall roam roam roam
Yeah, yeah
Cause I'm a creeper I will rob
All of your items it's my job
Yeah
I shoot my arrows in the air sometimes
Saying ay-oh, creeper's ko'd
Teabag his ghost and now his sulfur's mine
Sayin' ay-oh, mlg pro
And then I'll head back home
Where I'll smile with glee
That now I can make
Lots of tnt
'Cause I rule my world
Made in 3 by 3
I'm-a blow stuff up
With my tnt
I'm gonna blow it all up
Every mountain every valley
Ruler of the world, yup
All of the animals will fear me
Cause tnt is awesome
And tnt, is just really cool, is just really cool
I'm gonna shoot my arrows in the air, yeah
Arrows in the the air
Shoot your arrows in the air-air-air-air-air-air...
I shoot my arrows in the air sometimes
Saying ay-oh, creeper's ko'd
Teabag his ghost and now his sulfur's mine
Saying' ay-oh, mlg pro
And then I'll head back home
Where I'll smile with glee
That now I can make
Lots of tnt
'Cause I rule my world
Made in 3 by 3
I'm-a blow stuff up
With my tnt
